      <!-- Space for description of the Gambler's Ruin problem -->
      <p>
        The Gambler's Ruin problem is a famous concept in probability theory. A persistent gambler who constantly raises his bet to a fixed fraction every time he loses will eventually go 
        broke in a finite amount of bets. This problem is often modelled with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a> . In this model, the gambler will 
        return to the point of origin of the walk. In simple terms will go broke.

      <p class="h3">Reasons for the results</p>
      <p>
        In a fair game let <span class="mathjax-expression">\(d\)</span> be the amount of money that a gambler has at disposal at the beginning of the game. If he raises the bet of 
        <span class="mathjax-expression">\(\frac{d}{N}\)</span> every time he wins but does not reduce it when he loses, it will take at most N bets to end bankrupt, however big N is.
        By playing a fair game (let's say a toss coin), the gambler has chance of winning of <span class="mathjax-expression">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> on the first bet. And by simmetry the same chance
        of going broke. If he repeats the process, he has the same <span class="mathjax-expression">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of going broke. Hence at the second process he has chance of
        <span class="mathjax-expression">\((\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4}\)</span> chance of not going broke. This process repeats for N times. Then we will have
        <div class="mathjax-expression" style="font-size: larger;">    
            \(\sum_{i = 1}^{N} (\frac{1}{2})^i\)
        </div>
        chance that he goes broke which approaches 1.
      </p>
      <p class="h3">Relation with practical homework</p>
      <p>
        An application of this model could be the unfair coin toss: Suppose we have a finite amount of nickles and a coin. At every toss of the coin the player can either win 
        with a probability of <span class="mathjax-expression">\(p\)</span> or win with a probability of <span class="mathjax-expression">\(q = 1 - p\)</span>. In this case we used the model of the gambler and the coin
        but <a href="https://zionick1.github.io/nickstatistics.github.io/hw6/hw6.html">homework six</a> can model these two actors as the server (the gambler) and the coin toss (the probability that an attack can happen or not with a fixed probability). In my case I used 
        <span class="mathjax-expression">\(p = q\)</span> so we can consider it a fair game. Anyway the problem of a fair coin toss is discussed in the previous section of this paper.
