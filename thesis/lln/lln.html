        <p>In probability theory the <b>law of large numbers</b> is a theorem that describes the results of an experiment performed a large number of times. It states that: <i>the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed</i></p>
        <p>There are two forms of this law.</p>
        <p class="lead">Weak form</p>
        <p>The weak law of large numbers states that the sample average converges in probability towards the expected value.</p>
