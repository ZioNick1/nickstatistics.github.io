            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Poisson Point Process is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, frequently used to model events that occur randomly in time or space. It's named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Events occur independently over time or space.</li>
                <li>Events have an average rate (λ) at which they occur.</li>
                <li>The number of events in non-overlapping intervals follows a Poisson distribution.</li>
                <li>The process is memoryless, meaning that the time between events is exponentially distributed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Mathematical Representation</h3>
            <p>The Poisson Point Process can be mathematically represented as:</p>
            <p>N(t) ~ Poisson(λt)</p>

            <p>Where N(t) is the number of events in the interval [0, t], and λ is the average rate of events per unit time or space.

            <h3 class="mt-3">Applications</h3>
            <p>The Poisson Point Process is widely used in various fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Queueing theory to model arrival processes in systems like call centers.</li>
                <li>Environmental science to study the distribution of earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural events.</li>
                <li>Telecommunications to model the arrival of messages or packets in a network.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Properties</h3>
            <p>The Poisson Point Process has several important properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Events occur randomly and independently.</li>
                <li>The inter-arrival times follow an exponential distribution with mean 1/λ.</li>
                <li>The number of events in non-overlapping intervals is independent and follows a Poisson distribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Simulation</h3>
            <p>You can simulate a Poisson Point Process using various programming languages and tools. It can be a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing real-world processes.</p>
