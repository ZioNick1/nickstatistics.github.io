        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> <p class="lead">What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.</p><br> 
                Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analizing, and organizing data. In practice, statistics is the idea that we can learn about the properties of large set of objects which are <b>populations</b> and <b>samples</b> It's used in many disciplines like electrical engineering: 
                it's used in the manipulation of random signals, in medicine to analize clinical trials and draw conclusion in scientific studies. It's also used in cybersecurity for risk management and in machine learning. <br>
                To introduce descriptive and Inferential statistics we need to talk about populations and samples:
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Populations:</b> is a set made of statistical units. Some example may be a class of students, the population of a nation and so long so forth. The choice of a population is on who conducts the study, the only rule to be respected is that the population has to be relevant.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Samples:</b> it is simply a sub-set of a population. The sample procedure is pretty hard hence a new branch of statistics has been founded to occupy of this.</li>
                </ul>
                So Statistics is divided in two main branches:
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Descriptive statistics:</b> it's a term used to practice a descriptive analysis of the data. It's used when we need to present our raw data in a meaningful way</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Inferential statistics:</b> it's a set of tools that mathematicians use to draw conclusion about the characteristics of a population drawn from the characteristics of a sample and determine how certain can be those.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> <p class="lead">Describe the concepts of Population, Sample, Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset. </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Populations: </b> is a set made of statistical units. Some example may be a class of students, the population of a nation and so long so forth. The choice of a population is on who conducts the study, the only rule to be respected is that the population has to be relevant.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Samples:</b> it is simply a sub-set of a population. The sample procedure is pretty hard hence a new branch of statistics has been founded to occupy of this.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Variables: </b> a variable is a kind of quantitative data that can be measured in a relatively precise way. It's called variable because </li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Attribute: </b> an attribute is An attribute refers to the quality of a characteristic. The theory of attributes deals with qualitative types of characteristics that are calculated by using quantitative measurements. Therefore, the attribute needs slightly different kinds of statistical treatments, which the variables do not get.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><b>Level of measurement: </b> level of measurements indicates which values the variable can assume. We have four most important level of measurement: Nominal (latin name only), ordinal (for ordered level or ranks), interval (we have equal interval among sets), ratio (the scale always starts with a zero)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><p class="lead">Briefly describe the main sampling methods</p>
                <li class="list-item">The main sampling methods are divided in two main categories: <b>probability sampling methods</b> and <b>non probability sampling methods</b> <p class="p4">Probability sampling methods</p>
                   <ul>
                        <li class="list-item"><b>Simple random sampling:</b> using this way of sampling, every member of the population has the same chance to be included in the sampling frame. To conduct this sampling some random number generators can be used.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><b>Systematic sampling:</b> very similar to the previous one. With the only difference that every member is listed with a number and the sample members are chosen at regular intervals. The most important issue is that we have to be sure that there are no hidden patterns.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><b>Stratified sampling:</b>Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways. It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample. 
                            To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic. Then calculate the proportions between subgroups to see how many should be chosen for the sample and then apply systematic sampling for the scale.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><b>Cluster Sampling: </b></li>             
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
